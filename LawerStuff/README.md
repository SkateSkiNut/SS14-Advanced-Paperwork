# Documentation Practices

# Purpose of forms

the purpose of these templates is to allow security to prove happenings in and around the station, and for lawyer to call them out on it, so lawyer can give them a hard time about paperwork if security is not covering there backs. But, rather how i prefer to play lawyer is to help sec with there paperwork and be reasonable, this heps sec prove themselves though paperwork.








# Thoughts and Ideas

* Documentation Id Reference - easier to reference
* Documentation Revisions - know what version your on, wither or not its current
* Scope and Reference Sections - scope for the people that dont want to read the essay. refernce section to clearly reference other paperwork
* DCRs (Document Change Requests) - form to change existing documentation
* Prepopulated forms - ex: nuclear opertive incodent report, alow crew access to lethal wepondry or just sec, Drink order list at bar
